# CPP

C++ is a general-purpose programming language created by Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or "C with Classes". It has imperative, object-oriented, and generic programming features, while also providing facilities for low-level memory manipulation. Here are some key features and aspects of C++:

#  Key Features of C++:

* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):

Classes and Objects: Encapsulate data and functions that operate on the data.
Inheritance: Allows new classes to be defined based on existing classes.
Polymorphism: Enables functions and methods to operate differently based on the input.
Encapsulation: Hides the internal state of objects and only exposes necessary parts.

* Performance:

C++ allows direct manipulation of hardware and memory, making it suitable for performance-critical applications.

* Standard Template Library (STL):

A collection of template classes and functions for common data structures (like vectors, lists, and queues) and algorithms (like sorting, searching, and more).

* Generic Programming:

Templates: Enable writing generic and reusable code that works with any data type.

* Memory Management:

Manual control over memory allocation and deallocation using operators like new and delete.

*Low-Level Programming:

Allows low-level data manipulation, such as direct memory access, making it suitable for system/software development.

*Multiple Paradigms:

Supports procedural, object-oriented, and generic programming paradigms.
